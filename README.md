# qgiswebmap

This repository is basically a feasability test using QGIS2WEB to cobble together an interactive map for displaying coconut rhinoceros beetle roadside video survey roots with popup thumbnail images at points of interest. The prototype map is at https://aubreymoore.github.io/qgiswebmap/webmap/webmap.
